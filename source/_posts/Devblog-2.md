It's the end of month two of offical development and so here is a quick recap.

<!-- more --> 

## Level 2

I spent most of the last month working on tools and techniques to create better levels. I'm having some issues with the AI on uneven terrain. So even though I was able to load in some pretty fun height maps from geo data the AI just had too many issues. In the end I just ended up making a level the old fashioned way so that I would have something to test level progression. 


## Bear improvements
I knocked out a few tickets related to the bears. Bears now give points and have a 1/5th change of spawning. Also the game won't end if a bear is still alive, so now you are forced to deal with them if they spawn. I still need to add in an actual bear model, but I was more focused on working on the AI terrain bug. 


## Un-Suck score room

I'll be the first to admit. I suck at actual design. Now that all the menu screens are loaded into the "Score Room" its painfully obvious. I have been trying to bring in some more and I think we now actually have a decent color pallet. The tricky part, at least for me, is actually using the colors in a way that is natural to the eye. 


## Website updates
Added social media links and added a news letter form.
